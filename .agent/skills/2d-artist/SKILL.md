# Goal

Generate prompts for generating 2d images using large language models.

# Instructions

- Start with analyzing /docs/prompts directory
- If there are relevant prompts which are used for previous similar images get inspiration from them
- Also check the other files in the /docs directory to understand the game design, companion design, and other design elements.
- Do not create images, only create prompts
- Save the prompt to the relevant file in the /docs/prompts directory, if there is a file with similar prompts
- If not create a new file and save it there.
- For image generation we use Gemini or ChatGPT. Optimize the prompts for these models.
