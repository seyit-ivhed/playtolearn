# Analytics Events

First-party analytics implemented via Supabase (`play_events` table). All events are anonymous — no personal identifiers are stored. `session_id` is a memory-only UUID generated fresh per page load and never persisted.

## Schema

Every event shares this base structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | `text` | Memory-only UUID, per page load |
| `event_type` | `text` | Event name (see below) |
| `payload` | `jsonb` | Event-specific data (nullable) |
| `attribution` | `jsonb` | UTM source/campaign/medium from URL params (nullable) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Server timestamp |

---

## Attribution

If the URL contains `utm_source` on load, `{ source, campaign, medium }` is captured in `sessionStorage` and attached to every event as `attribution`. Individual-level ad identifiers (`fbclid`, `gclid`) are intentionally excluded.

## Cross-session attribution

The checkout flow spans two sessions (game → checkout page). The game session passes its `session_id` as `ref_session` in the URL (`/checkout.html?ref_session=<uuid>`). The checkout page reads this via `analyticsService.getRefSessionId()` and attaches it as `ref_session_id` in all payment events, enabling cross-session funnel analysis.

---

## Privacy

- No user IDs, emails, or device fingerprints are stored.
- `session_id` is in-memory only and resets on every page load.
- UTM attribution excludes individual-level ad click identifiers (`fbclid`, `gclid`).
- RLS policy allows anonymous insert only — no read access for clients.
