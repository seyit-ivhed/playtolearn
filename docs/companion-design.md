# Companion Design Document

This document defines the 4 MVP companions for Math Quest Adventures.

## Design Philosophy

- **No Role System** — Each companion has unique abilities tied to their identity
- **Stat Trade-offs** — Companions have meaningful HP/Damage trade-offs
- **Ultimate Variety** — Abilities cover different target types for tactical depth
