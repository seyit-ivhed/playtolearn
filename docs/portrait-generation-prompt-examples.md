## Companion Age Progression System

Companions visually age across 5 evolutions (0-4), starting as children at age 8 and maturing to young adults at age 18. Each evolution should maintain consistent facial structure, skin tone, eye color, and distinguishing features while showing natural aging.

| Evolution | Age | Expression | Visual Keywords |
|-----------|-----|------------|-----------------|
| Evo 0 | 8 | Naive, wide-eyed wonder | child, innocent, big curious eyes, soft round cheeks, small stature, simple outfit |
| Evo 1 | 10 | Curious, eager | young child, hopeful, slightly more confident, developing features |
| Evo 2 | 13 | Focused, learning | preteen, growing determination, face slightly longer, basic gear |
| Evo 3 | 16 | Confident, capable | teenager, maturing features, sharp focused eyes, refined equipment |
| Evo 4 | 18 | Determined, heroic | young adult, seasoned hero, resolute gaze, **magical equipment with glowing effects** |

### Consistency Guidelines

To ensure the same character looks consistent across evolutions, always include:
1. **Ethnicity & skin tone** — be specific (e.g., "warm brown skin", "olive complexion")
2. **Eye color & shape** — keep identical (e.g., "almond-shaped dark brown eyes")
3. **Hair color, texture & style** — same base, evolving styling (e.g., "thick curly black hair")
4. **Distinguishing features** — birthmarks, scars, unique accessories that persist
5. **Color palette** — maintain signature colors throughout evolutions

### Style Template for Companions:
