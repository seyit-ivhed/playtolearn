## 2. Game Mechanics

### 2.1 Journey & Adventure System

#### Journey Structure
The player's overall progression is called the **Journey**. The Journey is divided into multiple **Adventures**, each representing a self-contained story arc with its own theme, map, and challenges. Additional **Journey**s can be purchased as DLCs. Progressing through new journeys unlocks new companions, and styling options for Magical Canvas

#### Adventure Structure
Each **Adventure** consists of:
- **Theme & Story**: Unique narrative context (e.g., "The Goblin Forest", "Dragon's Lair")
- **Linear Map**: A path of connected nodes representing encounters
- **Encounters**: Individual challenges along the path (battles against monsters or puzzles to solve)
- **Boss Fight**: The final, climactic encounter that must be defeated to complete the adventure

#### Encounter Types
- **Battle Encounters**: Turn-based battle against monsters
- **Puzzle Encounters**: Logic and math puzzles to solve (future feature)
- **Boss Fights**: Epic battle against powerful enemies at the end of each adventure

### 2.2 Math Challenge System

**Dimension 2: Difficulty Level** (determines companion growth level)
- **Level 1**: Small numbers (e.g., single-digit)
- **Level 2**: Medium numbers (e.g., double-digit)
- **Level 3**: Large numbers (e.g., triple-digit or complex operations)
- **Level 4**: Very large numbers or multi-step problems
- **Level 5**: Expert level challenges

#### Challenge Presentation
- **Contextual Integration**: Math naturally woven into story scenarios or displayed as part of ultimate ability system
  - "The merchant needs 7 potions but only has 3. How many more should we buy?"
  - "There are goblins hiding behind rocks. Count them before they attack!"
  - "The bridge can hold 50 people. We have 32. How many more allies can cross?"
- **Multiple Choice**: For younger players and easier for touch screen

#### Player-Controlled Difficulty
- Players can choose both the math difficulty level for each encounter
- Game encourages players to increase difficulty when they perform well using a star system
- No forced adjustments - player always has final choice
- Progress tracking shows performance by skill and difficulty to help inform choices

### 2.3 Companion System

#### Core Design Philosophy
- **Permanent Companions**: Once unlocked, companions are yours forever
- **No Equipment**: Companions upgrade directly (simpler for children)
- **Party Selection**: Choose which 4 companions to bring on each encounter
- **Diverse Heroes**: Each companion has unique personality, appearance, and an ability

### 2.4 Encounter System

#### Encounter Flow
1. **Meeting**: Player meets monster or monster group
2. **Action Phase**: Turn-based encounter begins
3. **Victory/Defeat**: Gain companion experience, stars for recognition or retry option

#### Encounter Mechanics (Turn-Based)
- **Player Turn**:
  - **Action Phase**: The player commands their party members. Each companion must act once per turn.
  - **Standard Abilities**: Companions use their attack to do damage to the monster
  - **Completion**: The Player Turn ends automatically when all conscious companions have acted.

- **Ultimate Ability System**:
  - **Spirit Accumulation**: Companions passively generate **Spirit** at the start of every Player Turn.
  - **Ultimate Ready**: When a companion reaches **100 Spirit**, their Standard Ability is replaced by their unique **Ultimate Ability**.
  - **High-Stakes Math Challenge**: Activating an Ultimate triggers a math problem.
    - **Solve Correctly**: The Ultimate activates with a powerful effect (e.g., "Protective Stance", "Piercing Shot").
    - **Solve Incorrectly**: The ability **Fails**, consuming the Spirit and the turn without effect.
    - **Reset**: Spirit always resets to 0 after an Ultimate attempt.

- **Monster Turn**:
  - **Sequential Attacks**: Monsters attack one by one to a random companion.


### 2.5 Progression System

#### Journey Progression Through Realms
Each realm contains multiple adventures:
- Unique visual theme
- New monster types
- New kinds of puzzles
- New companions to unlock
- Final adventure with a boss fight that must be defeated to unlock next realm

## 3. Reward System

### 3.1 Encounter Rewards
- **Encounter XP**: Completing each encounter grants a fixed XP reward for all companions participated in the encounter
- **Companion Unlocks**: Completing an entire adventure unlocks a new companion who joins your party.
  - Example: Complete "The Oasis Quest" adventure → Unlock Tariq (Level 1)
