## Adventure 1 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts a journey through a dangerous desert, flowing from bottom to top (bottom-up perspective) without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the very bottom, the path begins at a small, refreshing oasis with palm trees and a clear water source, surrounded by rolling sand dunes and scattered rocks using sepia ink tones.

Moving upwards, the landscape becomes more rugged. An ancient sandstone archway blocks the path, looking monumental from this perspective. It features a large set of scales hanging by heavy chains from the arch. Further up, a high dune rises with a flat stone platform dedicated to observing the stars.

At the very top, the map opens into a vast, ominous crater-like arena surrounded by towering sand formations, the lair of the Sand Colossus. Behind the colossus arena, a dark, mysterious cave entrance is visible, leading into the ancient ruins.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.

## Adventure 2 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts a descent into a subterranean cavernous city, flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the top, a narrow canyon entrance transitions into a cool, shadowed cave system. Here, an ancient, crumbling stone cistern or fountain stands, still holding water in the darkness (Refill Canteen location).

Moving downwards, the cavern opens up into the ruins of an ancient Assyrian-style city. The path passes a massive wall section covered in glowing mathematical runes and equations (Equation puzzle). Further down, a large courtyard is paved with a distinct grid of colored stone tiles (Latin Square location), interspersed with makeshift bandit camps.

At the very bottom, a grand, expansive chamber houses the throne room of the Stone Emperor, surrounded by imposing statues and ancient machinery.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.

## Adventure 3 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts an ascent into the misty Jade Peaks, flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the top, the terrain features lush foothills with dense bamboo groves. A serene, glass-like pond reflects the surroundings, bordered by stone lanterns and mirrors (Mirror puzzle location).

Moving downwards, the path climbs steeply. A section of the path is paved with heavy stone plates engraved with numbers, requiring careful navigation (Number Path puzzle). Below this, a circle of standing stones emerges from the mist, arranged for observing constellations (Sequence puzzle). Hints of samurai banners appear among the rocks.

At the very bottom, the map culminates in a narrow mountain pass guarded by a fortified, traditional wooden gate with samurai crests—the stronghold of the Samurai Commander.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.

## Adventure 4 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts the approach and infiltration of the formidable Shogun's Fortress, flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the top, the path traverses a scarred battlefield. An open field is littered with pressure plates and traps on a stone floor, blocking the way (Number Path location). Tattered flags and wooden barricades suggest a history of conflict.

Moving downwards, the landscape is dominated by the fortress walls. A heavy iron gate blocks the ascent, locked by a mechanism involving complex gear equations (Equation puzzle location). Further in, a military training ground is marked with a distinct grid pattern for formation drills (Latin Square location).

At the very bottom, the map reveals the inner keep of the Evil Shogun—a majestic, dark-lacquered castle keep with multiple levels and curved roofs, bristling with defensive spikes.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.

## Adventure 5 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts a journey through the "Scorched Plains," flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the top, the path descends from iron-spiked foothills. A massive metal gate suspended over a lava flow blocks the path, held by heavy iron chains and counterweights (Balance puzzle location).

Moving downwards, the map opens into the vast savannah. A river of lava cuts through the land, crossable only by a set of specific floating stepping stones (Number Path location). Lower down, fields of jagged obsidian shards reflect the fiery landscape (Mirror puzzle), and a high volcanic ridge offers a view of smoke patterns in the sky (Sequence puzzle).

At the very bottom, the plains lead into a desolate "Volcanic Rim" and a massive, sun-blasted rocky arena where the ground smolders, the domain of the Inferno Mane.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.

## Adventure 6 Map Background

**Prompt:**
A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts a journey through the "Spirit Realm," flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines. Edges and corners should fade to black with black background.

At the top, the path begins at a shimmering threshold where the physical world ends. Floating islands drift in the void, one holding large, crystalline mirrors reflecting the nebula sky (Mirror puzzle location).

Moving downwards, the landscape becomes fractured. A translucent, glowing grid floats in the void (Latin Square location), surrounded by swirling "Discord Clouds." Further down, a bridge made of floating magical mathematics symbols connects two landmasses (Equation puzzle location).

At the very bottom, the map leads into the "Core of Harmony," a grand celestial theater where the Spirit King resides, filled with concentric circles of pure light.

The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.
