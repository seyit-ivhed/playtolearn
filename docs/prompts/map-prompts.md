# Art Generation Prompts

## Adventure 1 Map Background

**Prompt:**
> A vertical scrolling fantasy map background on ancient worn parchment paper. The map depicts a journey through a dangerous desert, flowing from top to bottom without any text, labels, or grid lines.
>
> At the top, the terrain consists of rolling sand dunes and small scattered rocks, evoking a dry, scorpion-infested wasteland.
>
> Moving downwards, the landscape becomes more rugged with jagged rocky outcrops and canyon walls, hinting at hidden ambushes. Soft wind patterns and swirling sand textures appear in the lower-middle section, representing ethereal spirits.
>
> At the very bottom, the map opens into a vast, ominous crater-like arena surrounded by towering sand formations, the lair of a massive colossus.
>
> The style is hand-drawn ink with sepia and brown tones, weathered paper texture, burnt edges, and detailed cartographic linework. High contrast, atmospheric shading, no markers, no paths, no UI elements.
>
> Try to make it as long as possible.
