## Art Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency with the *Math Quest Adventures* aesthetic, use the following style keywords for all Chapter Illustrations:

- **Art Style:** `Hand-painted digital illustration`, `stylized fantasy art`, `rich painterly textures`, `storybook illustration style`.
- **Lighting:** `Dramatic lighting`, `atmospheric shading`, `cinematic composition`.
- **Colors:** `Warm vibrant colors`, `regal jewel tones`.
- **Target:** `Google Nano Banana` (or other high-quality SDXL-based generators).
- **Aspect Ratio:** `16:9` (required by UI).
- **Resolution:** Recommended `1920x1080` (Full HD) or at least `1024x576`. The UI displays these at ~450px width, so `900px` width is ideal for retina displays.
