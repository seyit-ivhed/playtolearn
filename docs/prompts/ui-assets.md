## Backgrounds & Textures

### Old Parchment Texture
Used for puzzle backgrounds, chronicle pages, and scrolls.

**Prompt:**
> A high-quality, detailed texture of ancient, weathered parchment paper. The surface is rich with tactile painterly textures, showing natural aging with warm beige, ivory, and light amber tones. Subtle tea-stains, slight fraying at the edges, and a fine irregular grain give it an authentic, centuries-old feel. No text, no symbols, clean and expansive. Semi-realistic, hand-painted digital illustration, stylized fantasy art, storybook style, soft lighting. 16:9 aspect ratio, high resolution.

**Recommended Size:** 1920x1080 (for 16:9 screens) or 2048x2048 (for tiling/flexible use).
