## Backgrounds & Textures

### Old Parchment Texture
Used for puzzle backgrounds, chronicle pages, and scrolls.

**Prompt:**
> A high-quality, detailed texture of ancient, weathered parchment paper. The surface is rich with tactile painterly textures, showing natural aging with warm beige, ivory, and light amber tones. Subtle tea-stains, slight fraying at the edges, and a fine irregular grain give it an authentic, centuries-old feel. No text, no symbols, clean and expansive. Semi-realistic, hand-painted digital illustration, stylized fantasy art, storybook style, soft lighting. 16:9 aspect ratio, high resolution.

**Recommended Size:** 1920x1080 (for 16:9 screens) or 2048x2048 (for tiling/flexible use).

## Mirror Puzzle Assets

### Mystic Mirror Background
Used for the reflective side of the Mirror Puzzle to create an immersive magical illusion.

**Prompt:**
> A mystical, ancient silver mirror surface. The glass is slightly clouded with magical swirling mist in deep indigo and violet tones. The frame is barely visible at the very edges, made of intricate dark obsidian or weathered stone with faint gold filigree. The center of the mirror is a clear, reflective but magical surface, suitable for a grid overlay. High fantasy RPG style, ethereal glow, subtle sparkles, soft magical lighting, hand-painted digital illustration, 1:1 aspect ratio, high resolution.

### Ancient Runestone Token
Used as the active cells in the Mirror Puzzle, replacing simple colored squares.

**Prompt:**
> A small collection of ancient, weathered stone tiles or amulets. Each stone is a dark, natural granite color with rough, hand-carved edges. In the center of each, a different magical fantasy rune is deeply engraved, glowing with a vibrant, warm gold light.

### Stone Pedestal Surface (Left Side Background)
Used as the background for the original pattern side of the Mirror Puzzle.

**Prompt:**
> A top-down view of an ancient, weathered stone pedestal surface. The stone is a dark, natural grey with rough-hewn edges and fine cracks. The surface is flat and suitable for placing runestones upon. High fantasy RPG style, painterly texture, subtle stone grain, hand-painted digital art, storybook style, 1:1 aspect ratio, high resolution.

### Rustic Wooden Tray (Alternate Left Side Background)
Used as a more organic alternative background for the pattern side.
