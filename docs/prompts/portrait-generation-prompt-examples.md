## Companion Age Progression System

Companions visually age across 4 evolutions (0-3), starting as children at age 8 and maturing to young adults at age 18. Each evolution should maintain consistent facial structure, skin tone, eye color, and distinguishing features while showing natural aging.

| Evolution | Age | Expression | Visual Keywords |
|-----------|-----|------------|-----------------|
| Evo 0 | 8 | Naive, wide-eyed wonder | child, innocent, big curious eyes, soft round cheeks, small stature, simple outfit |
| Evo 1 | 12 | Focused, learning | preteen, growing determination, face slightly longer, basic gear |
| Evo 2 | 15 | Confident, capable | teenager, maturing features, sharp focused eyes, refined equipment |
| Evo 3 | 18 | Determined, heroic | young adult, seasoned hero, resolute gaze, **magical equipment with glowing effects** |

### Consistency Guidelines

To ensure the same character looks consistent across evolutions, always include:
1. **Ethnicity & skin tone** — be specific (e.g., "warm brown skin", "olive complexion")
2. **Eye color & shape** — keep identical (e.g., "almond-shaped dark brown eyes")
3. **Hair color, texture & style** — same base, evolving styling (e.g., "thick curly black hair")
4. **Distinguishing features** — birthmarks, scars, unique accessories that persist
5. **Color palette** — maintain signature colors throughout evolutions

### Style Template for Companions:
```
Portrait of a [AGE]-year-old [ETHNICITY] [BOY/GIRL] with [SKIN TONE],
[ROLE/CLASS TITLE], [EXACT EYE DESCRIPTION - color, shape],
[FACE SHAPE appropriate to age], [EXACT HAIR DESCRIPTION - color, texture, style],
wearing [DETAILED OUTFIT] <avoid pants or boots>, [WEAPON/ACCESSORY with detail level matching evolution].
[EXPRESSION matching evolution stage]. [DISTINGUISHING FEATURES].
Hand-painted digital illustration, stylized fantasy art, rich painterly textures,
warm vibrant colors, dramatic lighting.
```

### Art Style (All Evolutions):
Use consistent art style across all evolutions:
- "Hand-painted digital illustration"
- "Stylized fantasy art with painterly textures"
- "Semi-realistic stylized portrait"
- "High quality digital painting, storybook illustration style"

**Avoid:** 3D render, cartoon, anime, chibi

## Monster Design Guidelines

Monsters are **enemies** and should be depicted as **adversaries** to the players. They should be **mischievous, grumpy, or territorial** — while still being child-friendly (no blood or extreme violence). They should look like creatures the player *needs* to battle.

### Keywords to USE:
- **Personality:** adversarial, mischievous, grumpy, territorial, bumbling bandit, sneaky
- **Features:** rounded shapes, expressive narrowed eyes, ready-to-snap pinchers, sturdy limbs
- **Art style:** Stylized 3D digital illustration, cartoon, colorful
- **Expression:** sneaky smirk, grumpy scowl, territorial glare, pouncing growl

### Keywords to AVOID:
- ❌ friendly, helpful, waving hello, giggling, smiling warmly
- ❌ blood, extreme violence, realistic horror, grimdark

### Style Template for Monsters:
```
Portrait of a [CREATURE TYPE], [ADVERSARIAL ADJECTIVE], [SIZE] creature with
[STURDY FEATURES], [EXPRESSIVE EYES], [BODY DESCRIPTION].
[ADVERSARIAL POSE/EXPRESSION]. Stylized 3D digital illustration, child-friendly, bright vibrant colors,
