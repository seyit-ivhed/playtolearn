## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep the Center Clear:** The campfire and companions will be rendered on top of the background, so ensure the central area of the illustration isn't too cluttered with large vertical elements.
2. **Focus on Light:** The contrast between the central "warmth" of the camp and the "dangerous" environment outside is key to the mood.
3. **Consistency:** Always lead with "Hand-painted digital illustration" to match the companion character art.
