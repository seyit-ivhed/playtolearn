### 3. Create Prompt (For AI Generation)

Structure your generation prompt:
```
A [asset description] for kids' educational space game,
[size] dimensions, [color palette], [key features],
[style notes], child-friendly aesthetic,
[viewing angle], isolated on [background],
appropriate for ages 6-12
```

**Prompt Best Practices**:
- Specify exact colors from palette when possible
- Include "child-friendly" or "appropriate for ages 6-12"
- Describe style as "modern semi-realistic" or "cartoon-realistic"
- Be specific about size and proportions
- Mention viewing angle (front, side isometric)
- Request transparent background or specific background color

### 4. Generate Multiple Variations

- Create 2-3 variations of each asset
- Test different styles or angles
- Compare against existing assets
- Choose best fit for game aesthetic

### 5. Review Checklist

Before finalizing any asset, verify:

- [ ] **Matches Color Palette**: Uses colors from visual style guide
- [ ] **Appropriate Size**: Correct dimensions for use case
- [ ] **Child-Friendly**: No scary, violent, or inappropriate elements
- [ ] **Clear Silhouette**: Recognizable even at small sizes
- [ ] **Consistent Style**: Matches existing game assets
- [ ] **High Contrast**: Readable against space backgrounds
- [ ] **Technical Quality**: Clean edges, no artifacts
- [ ] **File Format**: PNG with transparency or specified format

### 6. Create Animation States (If Applicable)

For animated assets, create:
- **Idle state**: Default appearance
- **Active/hover state**: When interacted with
- **Disabled state**: Grayed out, lower opacity
- **Transition frames**: If needed for smooth animation

### 7. Document The Asset

Add to asset library with:
- File name (descriptive, lowercase, underscores)
- Dimensions
- Color codes used
- Purpose/usage notes
- Related assets (variants, levels)
- Date created

### 8. Test In Context

- Place asset in actual game environment
- Test at actual display size
- Verify readability and visibility
- Check against multiple backgrounds
- Test on different screen sizes

## Asset Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming for all assets:

### Format
```
[category]_[type]_[variant]_[level/state].png
```

### Examples
```
ship_player_basic.png
ship_player_upgraded.png
ship_enemy_pirate_damaged.png
weapon_laser_icon_level1.png
weapon_laser_effect.png
bg_planet_ice_large.png
bg_nebula_purple.png
ui_button_primary_normal.png
ui_button_primary_hover.png
effect_explosion_small.png
shield_energy_active.png
```

### Category Prefixes
- `ship_` - Spaceships (player and enemy)
- `weapon_` - Weapon modules
- `shield_` - Shield modules
- `armor_` - Armor components
- `bg_` - Background objects (planets, asteroids, etc.)
- `effect_` - Visual effects (explosions, beams, etc.)
- `ui_` - UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.)
- `icon_` - Icons and badges
- `particle_` - Particle system elements
