# Developer Expectations

This document defines the standards, rules, and practices expected from every developer (human or AI) contributing to this codebase. Read this before starting any implementation, bug fix, or code review.

Also read [technical-architecture.md](technical-architecture.md) before planning any implementation.

---

## Architecture

- Always consult [technical-architecture.md](technical-architecture.md) before planning. Stick to the architectural guidance there.
- Respect the established project structure. Do not introduce new patterns without strong justification.

---

## Code Style

### Comments
- Do not write extensive comments. Write self-explanatory code with good variable, function, and class names instead.
- Only add a comment when logic is genuinely complex and cannot be made clearer through naming alone.

### Conditional Statements
- Always use curly brackets in conditional statements, even for single-line bodies.

```typescript
// Good
if (companion.level >= EXPERIENCE_CONFIG.MAX_LEVEL) {
  return false;
}

// Bad
if (companion.level >= EXPERIENCE_CONFIG.MAX_LEVEL) return false;
```

### Imports
- Use relative imports, not absolute/path-alias imports.

```typescript
// Good
import { PuzzleType } from '../../../../types/adventure.types';

// Bad
import { PuzzleType } from '@/types/adventure.types';
```

---

## TypeScript

### No `enum`
- Do not use `enum`. Use `const` objects with `as const` and derived types instead (required for `erasableSyntaxOnly` / `verbatimModuleSyntax` compatibility).

```typescript
// Good
export const MyEnum = {
  A: 'A',
  B: 'B',
} as const;
export type MyEnum = typeof MyEnum[keyof typeof MyEnum];

// Bad
export enum MyEnum {
  A = 'A',
  B = 'B',
}
```

### No `any`
- Never use the `any` type. It causes lint failures and masks real type errors.
- Do not cast through `unknown` to work around type mismatches. Define, extend, or inherit types properly instead.

```typescript
// Bad
newParty = CombatEngine.tickStatusEffects(newParty as unknown as BattleUnit[]) as unknown as EncounterUnit[];
```

### Parameter Validation
- At the start of a function, validate that required parameters and dependencies exist and have the expected type.
- Log a `console.error` and return early if validation fails. Do not substitute default values.

```typescript
if (!stats) {
  console.error(`Companion stats not found in levelUpCompanion for ${companionId}`);
  return;
}

if (typeof stats.level !== 'number') {
  console.error(`Invalid level for companion ${companionId}`);
  return;
}
```

## Modularization and File Size

- Break long functions into smaller, focused functions.
- Aggressively modularize `.tsx` files into smaller components.
- When a `.ts` or `.tsx` file exceeds **250 lines**, consider refactoring into smaller units.
- Each component should have a **single responsibility**. If a component does more than one thing, split it.

---

## React

### Minimize `useEffect`
- Avoid `useEffect` wherever possible. Prefer native React reactivity (derived state, memoization, event handlers).
- Only use `useEffect` when there is no cleaner alternative.

### Component Testability
- If a `.tsx` component contains complex logic, extract that logic to a `.ts` file and write unit tests there.
- Do not write unit tests for `.tsx` files directly.

---

## Localization

- All user-readable text must be localized using the i18n system. Never hardcode strings visible to users in code or data files.
- Exception: companion names do not need to be localized.

---

## Styling and Animation

- Use CSS rules and transitions for animations first.
- Only introduce `framer-motion` if CSS becomes genuinely too complex or insufficient.

---

## Polymorphism Over Conditionals

- Avoid long `switch/case` or `if/else` chains. Refactor into polymorphic solutions (strategy pattern, lookup maps, etc.) instead.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for `.ts` files that contain non-trivial logic.
- Do not write unit tests for `.tsx` files — extract logic to `.ts` files first.
- Do not add unit tests to files that have an explicit comment opting out of unit testing.
- Unit tests must not perform I/O operations (no file reads, network calls, database access).

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- Never assert on element text content. Use `data-testid` attributes instead.
- Always use the `{ force: true }` option when clicking buttons.

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code (your own or others'), verify:

1. Architecture aligns with [technical-architecture.md](technical-architecture.md).
2. No hardcoded user-visible strings — all text goes through i18n.
3. No `any` types or unsafe `unknown` casts.
4. No `enum` — use `const` + `as const` pattern.
5. Relative imports used throughout.
6. Curly brackets on all conditionals.
7. `useEffect` usage is justified and minimal.
8. Functions and components have single responsibilities.
9. Files under 250 lines (flag if over).
10. Complex `.tsx` logic is extracted to `.ts` files with tests.
11. Unit tests present for non-trivial `.ts` logic, passing, and I/O-free.
12. E2E tests use `data-testid`, not text content.
13. Parameters validated at function entry with `console.error` + early return on failure.
14. Animations use CSS first; `framer-motion` only when necessary.
15. Long conditionals replaced with polymorphic patterns.
16. Comments only where logic is genuinely opaque.
