# Story and Journey: The Wandering Companions

## Overview

**The Chronicles of Realms** follows the journey of young adventurers traveling the world together, growing through friendship and shared experiences. The player reads and follows their story as an observer, experiencing their adventures through the pages of "The Chronicles."

## Core Narrative Concept

### The Journey Begins

Two young friends from neighboring regions—**Amara** and **Tariq**—decide to explore the world together. Amara, a young traveler from a distant southern realm, visits Tariq's homeland in the desert and Assyrian city. Inspired by each other's stories and eager to see what lies beyond their homes, they set off on a journey of discovery.

As they travel from realm to realm, they meet other young adventurers who join their growing band of companions. Together, they form a close-knit traveling group—a found family of children exploring the world, overcoming challenges, and growing stronger through their experiences.

### Player Perspective

The player is **not a character in the story**. Instead, they are reading "The Chronicles"—a collection of adventure stories documenting the companions' journey. Each adventure is a chapter in this ongoing tale, and the player experiences the story as it unfolds, like reading an interactive storybook.

## Character Growth and Relationships

### Evolution as Maturation

Companions literally **grow up** through their adventures. Each evolution represents them aging and maturing:

- **Age 8** (Evo 0): Young children, just starting their journey
- **Age 12** (Evo 1): Pre-teens, becoming capable
- **Age 15** (Evo 2): Teens, experienced adventurers
- **Age 18** (Evo 3): Young adults, fully matured

### The Mentorship Dynamic

As Amara and Tariq grow older through their journey, they naturally become mentors to younger companions who join later:

### Companion Recruitment

Each new realm introduces companions who:
- Are dealing with challenges in their homeland
- Are inspired by Amara and Tariq's friendship and courage
- Want to see the world beyond their realm
- Join the group after the companions help solve their realm's problems

The group grows organically, with each new companion adding to the family dynamic.
