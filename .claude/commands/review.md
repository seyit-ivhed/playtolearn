# Goal

Review code, branches, or pull requests for quality, best practices, and potential issues

# Instructions

- Identify the files which have been edited or added in the branch or pull request
- Read /docs/developer-expectations.md for all programming rules, standards, and practices expected in this codebase
- Look at the /docs directory and read all the files to understand the project structure and architecture
- Go through all the files edited or added in the current branch or pull request and check for any violations of the rules, standards or general good software development practices.
- Look for test coverage of .ts files. If you see strong gaps suggest improvements. However do not add unit tests for files which has explicit comments saying they should not be unit tested. Do not add unit tests for .tsx files, but check if the logic in them is properly extracted into .ts files and those are unit tested.
- Don't limit yourself to only the files edited or added, also check for any related files that might be affected by the changes
- Make a plan for improving the code and execute all improvements including the minor or optional ones.
- Check security: any new Supabase tables have RLS enabled; edge functions verify the user's JWT before any data operation; no secrets or service role keys appear in client-side code.
- Check i18n completeness: every new user-visible string has keys added to both `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/sv.json`.
- Check accessibility: interactive elements have accessible labels, modals trap focus and close on Escape, semantic HTML is used correctly (buttons for actions, links for navigation).

# Output

After executing all improvements, produce a concise summary:
- List every file changed and why.
- List any issues found but intentionally left (e.g. out of scope, requires product decision).
- Flag any security, migration safety, or breaking-change concerns that need human review.
